A notebook consists of \"cells\", some of which contain text (like this one), and some of which contain software, or \"code\", like the next one. You can run the code in a cell by clicking the play button (the triangle). Move your mouse over the cell below so you see the play button, and click it now to run the cell. The first time you run code in a notebook it may take a few seconds to start running, so be patient. You should see a green check mark on the left once it is finished."

For this reason, programmers try to organize their code into chunks that can be re-used for many different purposes, and they share these chunks with each other to make the whole field more efficient and productive. The most basic kind of \"chunk\" of code is called a function. To put Python code in a function, one writes a special line that announces the beginning of the function, and then indents whatever lines of code after that are supposed to be part of the function. The function can then be \"called\" by name from other parts of the code. Let's see an example."

Non-programmers are often surprised to learn that programmers typically call functions in packages without reading the code inside the functions. They instead rely on separate documentation to understand what parameters they can provide and what they can expect a function to do. This approach limits programmers' understanding the foundations on which they build. But it is the only practical way forward, because the foundations are usually intricate and extensive.\n",
