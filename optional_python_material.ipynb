        "#Variables and Data Types\n",
        "Data, parameters, and other values in software are stored in named variabes. Variables can have different \"types\", such as text, numbers, etc. The type determines what kind of information can go in a variable, how a variable's value is encoded as bits in the computer's memory, and what can be done with a variable (e.g. whether it can be added to another variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "Important types in Python include strings (sequences of text characters), booleans (true or false values), integers, and floats (numbers with decimal points). The latter are called \"floats\" because the way their bits are organized allows the position of the decimal point to move, or float, to the appropriate position among a fixed number of significant digits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each variable has a type, but (in contrast with many other languages) the programmer does not have to explicitly name the type in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "A variable can have the special value \"None\", which essentially means that the variable's value is undefined.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code below creates variables and assigns values of different types to them. If curiosity gets the better of you, you can print a variable's type using the function \"type\", as below. You do not have to import this function from a package. It is one of the \"built-in\" functions that are always available in Python programs."

        "Let's dissect that last line. We are calling the built-in function, \"print\". The print function requires an \"argument\" (a parameter), which carries the value that will be printed. The argument is inside the brackets. It is a string, 'First {} then {}'. Python does not pass that string to the print function directly. Each string in Python has a special kind of function associated with it, which is called \"format\". If you write a string, then a dot, then \"format\", Python calls that particular string's format function. The format function also has arguments, which are values to incorporate into the string. The format function produces a new string, which is similar to the original, but with the {} parts replaced with the arguments to the format function. It is that new string that is passed to the print function.\n",

This is consistent with the syntax of loops and functions. Second, notice the keywords \"if\", \"elif\", and \"else\". If the condition beside the \"if\" holds, then the indented line after it runs, and that's that. If not, the condition beside the \"elif\" is checked and if it holds then the associated indented code runs. If neither of those conditions holds, then the code under the \"else\" runs. Finally, notice the double-equals sign, \"==\". That is an operation that checks whether the things on each side are the same and produces a boolean \"True\" value if they are, or \"False\" otherwise.
